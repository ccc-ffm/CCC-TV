# How to Contribute? #

We do not have any hard restrictions. Just clone the repository and work with the code. Get familiar with the application first.

The server code is hosted by "aus der Technik - Simon & Simon GbR" as a sponsoring for ccc-ffm. We do accept pull requests and we do accept new features! 

The best way to get your features in is to discuss your idea on our public mailing list: CCC FFM Public <public@lists.ccc-ffm.de>
Please write a short summery about your feature and stick it within your pull request. 

We plan to update the application on a monthly basis. 

The application is build on a mindset you have to agree to, if you want to deploy your code into the main branch: 

* Usability over Functions (make it good, not feature rich!)
* Read the: [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/tvos/human-interface-guidelines/)
* First use data that is always there
* Try to help the user to find content that belongs to them
* Avoid text-inputs like heavy search fields
* be nice to each other
